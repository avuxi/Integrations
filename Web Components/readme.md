Running a Web Component
=======================

To run an AVUXI TopPlace map layer on a google maps web component, first ensure you have the necessary bower components installed.

First, install Bower via NPM:
`npm install -g bower`

Then install the necessary Bower components from the same folder in which the HTML file is held:
`bower install --save GoogleWebComponents/google-map`
